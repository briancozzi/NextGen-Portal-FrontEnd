# NextGen Portal FrontEnd

This project is a basic setup for a **Vite** React application with **TypeScript**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/briancozzi/NextGen-Portal-FrontEnd.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. **Install dependencies**

If you are using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn
```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally for development:

If you are using `npm`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

If you are using `npm`:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or if you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will bundle the application for production in the `dist/` folder.
